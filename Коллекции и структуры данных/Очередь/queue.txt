A queue is a useful data structure in programming. It is similar to the ticket queue outside a cinema hall,
 where the first person entering the queue is the first person who gets the ticket.

Queue follows the First In First Out (FIFO) rule - the item that goes in first is the item that comes out first.

-------------------

A circular queue is the extended version
 of a regular queue where the last element is connected to the first element. Thus forming a circle-like structure.

A priority queue is a special type of queue in which each element is associated with a priority value.
 And, elements are served on the basis of their priority.
 That is, higher priority elements are served first.
